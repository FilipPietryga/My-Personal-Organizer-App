My Personal Project for an organizer app idea, currently in INDEV version.

The app is planned to have:
  - a working functionality of placing tasks in the todo-list
  - a callendar in which the tasks could be placed
  - a kanban board in which these could be manipulated

All of these should utilize common service for the task manipulation.

Current TODO:
  - test the todo-list
  - introduce styling for the todo-list
  - introduce styling for the interface
